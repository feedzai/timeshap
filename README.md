# TimeSHAP
TimeSHAP is a model-agnostic, recurrent explainer that builds upon KernelSHAP and 
extends it to the sequential domain.
TimeSHAP computes event/timestamp- feature-, and cell-level attributions. 
As sequences can be arbitrarily long, TimeSHAP also implements a pruning algorithm
based on Shapley Values, that finds a subset of consecutive, recent events that contribute
the most to the decision.


This repository is the code implementation of the TimeSHAP algorithm 
present in the paper `TimeSHAP: Explaining Recurrent Models through Sequence Perturbations`
published in KDD 2021.

### TImeSHAP Explanation Methods
TimeSHAP offers several methods to use depending on the desired explanations.
Local methods provide detailed view of a model decision corresponding
to a specific sequence being explained.
Global methods aggregate local explanations of a given dataset
to present a global view of the model.

#### Local Explanations
##### Pruning

[`local_pruning()`](src/timeshap/explainer/pruning.py) performs the pruning
algorithm on a given sequence with a given user defined tolerance and returns 
the pruning index along the information for plotting.

[`plot_temp_coalition_pruning()`](src/timeshap/plot/pruning.py) plots the pruning 
algorithm information calculated by `local_pruning()`.

##### Event level explanations

[`local_event()`](src/timeshap/explainer/event_level.py) calculates event level explanations
of a given sequence with the user-given parameteres and returns the respective 
event-level explanations.

[`plot_event_heatmap()`](src/timeshap/plot/event_level.py) plots the event-level explanations
calculated by `local_event()`.

##### Feature level explanations

[`local_feat()`](src/timeshap/explainer/feature_level.py) calculates feature level explanations
of a given sequence with the user-given parameteres and returns the respective 
feature-level explanations.

[`plot_feat_barplot()`](src/timeshap/plot/feature_level.py) plots the feature-level explanations
calculated by `local_feat()`.

##### Cell level explanations

[`local_cell_level()`](src/timeshap/explainer/cell_level.py) calculates cell level explanations
of a given sequence with the respective event- and feature-level explanations
and user-given parameteres, returing the respective cell-level explanations.

[`plot_cell_level()`](src/timeshap/plot/cell_level.py) plots the feature-level explanations
calculated by  `local_cell_level()`.

##### Local Report

[`local_report()`](src/timeshap/explainer/local_methods.py) calculates TimeSHAP 
local explanations for a given sequence and plots them.

#### Global Explanations


##### Global pruning statistics

[`prune_all()`](src/timeshap/explainer/pruning.py) performs the pruning
algorithm on multiple given sequences.

[`pruning_statistics()`](src/timeshap/plot/pruning.py) calculates the pruning
statistics for several user-given pruning tolerances using the pruning
data calculated by `prune_all()`, returning a `pandas.DataFrame` with the statistics.


##### Global event level explanations

[`event_explain_all()`](src/timeshap/explainer/event_level.py) calculates TimeSHAP 
event level explanations for multiple instances given user defined parameters.

[`plot_global_event()`](src/timeshap/plot/event_level.py) plots the global event-level explanations
calculated by `event_explain_all()`.

<img src="resources/images/global_event.png" width="100">

##### Global feature level explanations

[`feat_explain_all()`](src/timeshap/explainer/feature_level.py) calculates TimeSHAP 
feature level explanations for multiple instances given user defined parameters.

[`plot_global_feat()`](src/timeshap/plot/feature_level.py) plots the global feature-level 
explanations calculated by `feat_explain_all()`.

<img src="resources/images/global_feat.png" width="100">


##### Global report
[`global_report()`](src/timeshap/explainer/global_methods.py) calculates TimeSHAP 
explanations for multiple instances, aggregating the explanations on two plots
and returning them.

## Tutorial
In order to demonstrate TimeSHAP interfaces and methods, you can consult
[AReM.ipynb](notebooks/AReM/AReM.ipynb). 
In this tutorial we get an open-source dataset, process it, train 
Pytorch recurrent model with it and use TimeSHAP to explain it, showcasing all 
previously described methods.

Additionally, we also train a TensorFlow model on the same dataset 
[AReM_TF.ipynb](notebooks/AReM/AReM_TF.ipynb).
